Run the file 'Index.html' at the root of this zip file in any webbrowser you prefer. 
You can create new notes by clicking on 'Create New Session'.
The sidebar will update with (and save) the newly created note.
From here, you can expand it to see some brief summary information.
A newly created note is automatically selected. You can select any note with the checkmark button in the side bar or by double clicking on it.

The large sections in the main body (Session Information, Characters, Loot, and Highlights) all expand when clicked.
You can add characters, loot, and highlights by filling in the text forms and either clicking the button to add them or by hitting the enter key.
Everything is saved in real time (including mistakes) and there isn't an undo button.

You can copy a formatted note either in the 'Session Information' section via the 'Generate Discord Markdown' button or with the green clipboard button in the sidebar.

Deleting sessions is harder than just clicking the button. A safety prompt will ask you to type 'DELETE' in capital letters (caps do matter) before a session will really be deleted.

Each session is saved locally to your own computer. There is no centralized database, so only you have access to these notes. They are also browser based, so if you change your web browser, you'll lose any previously made notes (but they'll still be accessible on the original browser)

Finally, the gold entries can be designated as either 'Each' or as 'Total'.

Each will post it as is, everyone gets this much gold.
Total will treat it as a pool that needs to be divided.

Everything will be displayed in terms of gold each character gets at the end, with some dynamic totaling for gold amounts.

If there are any bugs, please let me know and I will look into it.
