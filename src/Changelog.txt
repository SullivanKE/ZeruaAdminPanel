#Zerua Admin Panel
## Version 1.1.3
### New Features
- Player and Character tab is now partially functional.
 - This change allows you to create, but not delete or modify existing players
 - You can now see characters and players, with some very basic information

### Bug Fixes
- Sidebar stays open when you select a session
- Sidebar correctly displays the player name rather than their database number

### Todo
